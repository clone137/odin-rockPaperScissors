# odin-rockPaperScissors

this project is from the Foundations section

we now have a web UI with three buttons for the player to choose rock, paper or scissors.
additionally, there is a reset button which resets everything as it should be at the start
of a new game.

there is a separate DIV to output the choices from the current round and the score. once a
score of 5 has been reached by either player, the rock, paper, and scissors buttons are
disabled and the overall score is announced.
